    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tandoori chicken is an iconic dish originating from the Indian subcontinent, celebrated for its rich flavors and vibrant presentation. The preparation begins with chicken pieces, often bone-in, marinated in a mixture of yogurt and an array of spices such as cumin, coriander, turmeric, cayenne pepper, and garam masala. This marinade not only tenderizes the meat but also infuses it with a depth of flavors. After marinating for several hours, the chicken is traditionally cooked in a tandoor, a cylindrical clay oven heated by charcoal or wood fire. The high temperatures of the tandoor create a distinctive smoky flavor and a beautifully charred exterior while keeping the meat succulent and juicy inside. The final dish is typically garnished with fresh cilantro and a squeeze of lemon, adding a fresh burst of flavor that balances the spices</p>
    <p>The allure of tandoori chicken lies not just in its taste but also in its visual appeal. The use of turmeric and sometimes red food coloring in the marinade gives the chicken a vibrant red or orange hue, making it as visually striking as it is delicious. The contrast of the charred, slightly crispy exterior with the tender, flavorful interior makes for an unforgettable culinary experience. Tandoori chicken is often served with a side of cooling raita, a yogurt-based condiment, and accompanied by naan or rice, which help to temper the dish's spiciness. Whether enjoyed as an appetizer, main course, or part of a larger feast, tandoori chicken is a testament to the rich culinary traditions and the mastery of spice that defines Indian cuisine.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds chicken, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 medium lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups plain yogurt</li>
        <li>½ medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red food coloring (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon yellow food coloring (Optional)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons finely chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>1 medium lemon, cut into wedges</li>
    </ul>    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove and discard skin from chicken pieces. Cut slits into meat and place into a shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with lemon juice and salt. Let sit for 20 minutes. </li>
        <li>  Mix yogurt, onion, garlic, garam masala, ginger, and cayenne pepper together in a medium bowl until smooth, then stir in food coloring.  </li>
        <li> Spread yogurt mixture over chicken, cover, and refrigerate for 6 to 24 hours (the longer the better).  </li>
        <li>When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove chicken from marinade. Discard remaining marinade. </li>
        <li> Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink and the juices run clear. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Garnish with cilantro and lemon wedges</li>
    </ol>
