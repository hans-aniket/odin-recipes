    <h1>Naan</h1>
    <a href="../images/naan.webp">naan</a>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Naan is a traditional Indian flatbread renowned for its soft, chewy texture and slightly smoky flavor, which comes from being cooked in a tandoor, a cylindrical clay oven. The dough is typically made from a mixture of white flour, yeast, milk, yogurt, and a bit of sugar, which gives it a light and airy quality. Once the dough has risen, it is divided into balls, rolled out into flat discs, and then slapped onto the sides of the tandoor. The intense heat of the oven quickly cooks the naan, creating characteristic charred spots and a crisp, yet tender crust. This method of cooking not only imparts a unique flavor but also gives the bread its signature texture that is both pillowy and slightly chewy.</p>
    <p>Naan is incredibly versatile and can be served plain or with a variety of toppings and fillings. Common variations include garlic naan, brushed with butter and sprinkled with minced garlic and herbs, or cheese naan, which is stuffed with a melty cheese filling. It often accompanies a wide array of Indian dishes, from rich and spicy curries to kebabs and tandoori dishes. Naan is perfect for scooping up sauces and gravies or can be enjoyed on its own as a flavorful snack. Its ability to complement both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes makes it a beloved staple in Indian cuisine, appreciated for its comforting texture and adaptability to various flavors.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 cup warm water</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>4 ½ cups bread flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic (Optional)</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl. Let stand about 10 minutes, until frothy.. </li>
        <li> Meanwhile, generously oil a large bowl.  </li>
        <li> Stir sugar, milk, egg, and salt into the yeast mixture. Mix in enough flour to make a soft dough. </li>
        <li> Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth, 6 to 8 minutes. </li>
        <li> Place dough in the prepared oil, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.  </li>
        <li>Punch down dough on a lightly floured surface, and knead in garlic. Pinch off small handfuls of dough about the size of a golf ball; you should have about 14. Roll each piece into a ball and place on a tray. Cover with a towel, and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes. </li>
        <li> Meanwhile, preheat a large grill pan over high heat. </li>
        <li> Roll each piece of dough into a thin circle. </li>
        <li>Brush some melted butter on the preheated grill pan. Place a few pieces of dough in the pan (as many as you can fit) and cook until puffy and lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Brush butter onto the uncooked sides, flip, and cook until browned, 2 to 4 more minutes. Remove from the grill and repeat to cook the remaining naan.</li>
        <li> Enjoy! </li>
